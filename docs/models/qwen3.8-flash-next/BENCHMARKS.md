# Qwen3.8 Flash-Next benchmarks

AMD Strix Halo `gfx1151`, 128 GB unified memory. Unsloth `UD-Q4_K_XL` target and
shared-Q8_0 MTP sidecar; Gufo uses adaptive MTP. HTTP, greedy, thinking off.
Gufo single-user tg: September 27, 2026 (`f797b5b`); pp and other results:
September 22–23. Concurrency uses the unchanged short-context attention path.
llama.cpp uses `b11069` for AR and `6fcaa16f` for MTP.

Positive gain favors Gufo.

## Framework fork: coding fixtures

September 30, 2026 UTC, Framework Desktop Ryzen AI Max+ 395 / Radeon 8060S,
128 GB. This machine's GCC 16.2.1 / ROCm 10 stack on both arms; upstream
`f783fedb` versus the prompt-lookup fork. Production binaries, identical weights,
C1, **196,608-token context capacity**, MTP ceiling seven, thinking off, seed 73.
One warmup and three cache-bypassed tg128 requests per fixture; medians below.
Decode rates exclude prefill; HTTP wall time includes the complete request.

| Fixture | Prompt tokens | Upstream decode (tok/s) | Fork decode (tok/s) | Gain | HTTP wall, upstream → fork (ms) |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Prose control | 1,965 | 37.35 | 37.40 | +0.1% | 4,745 → 4,746 |
| Copy code, greedy | 1,068 | 73.67 | 83.30 | +13.1% | 2,659 → 2,452 |
| Edit code, greedy | 1,088 | 71.33 | 84.83 | +18.9% | 2,733 → 2,439 |
| Repetition, greedy | 1,911 | 83.24 | 105.73 | +27.0% | 2,830 → 2,493 |
| Sampled code control | 1,088 | 67.29 | 67.37 | +0.1% | 2,838 → 2,837 |

All **15/15** measured completion byte hashes and token counts match upstream.
Sampled control uses temperature 1, top-p 0.95 and top-k 20; lookup is greedy
text-only. Copy/edit complete-request times improve 7.8% / 10.7%. These synthetic
fixtures do not measure completed OpenCode tasks. A separate long tool-history
check reaches 134,063 prompt tokens with exact replay and prefix reuse; its
bounded EOS continuations are qualification cases, not tg128 speed samples.
